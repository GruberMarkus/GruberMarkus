Hi,

GitHub is my platform of choice for publishing several open-source projects I created, own and maintain. If you want to know more about me, browse my [LinkedIn profile](https://at.linkedin.com/in/gruberma).


[Set-OutlookSignatures](https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures) (centrally manage and deploy Outlook text signatures and Out of Office auto reply messages) and [Export-RecipientPermissions](https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Export-RecipientPermissions) (document, filter and compare Exchange permissions) are among the most popular of my projects.
They are Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS), feature rich and can save companies thousands or even tens of thousand Euros/US-Dollars per year in comparison to commercial software.
