Hi,

My name is Markus Gruber. I am a Consultant, Digital Advisor and Product Manager with more than two decades of international experience (details on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gruberma/)).

GitHub is my platform of choice for publishing several open-source projects I created, own and maintain.

[Set-OutlookSignatures](https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures) (centrally manage and deploy Outlook text signatures and Out of Office auto reply messages) is the most popular of my projects.
It is Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS), feature rich and can save companies thousands or even tens of thousand Euros/US-Dollars per year in comparison to commercial software.

If you consider sponsoring, please visit any of my repositories and click the sponsor button, or contact me for consulting and project work.

Please feel free to visit the issues page of my repositories to voice any of your thoughts or concerns.

I am looking forward to hearing from you!
