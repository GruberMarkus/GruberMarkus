Hi,

My name is Markus Gruber and I am a Digital Advisor and Product Manager from Austria.

I am the owner and maintainer of several open source tools.
[Set-OutlookSignatures](https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures) (centrally manage and deploy Outlook text signatures and Out of Office auto reply messages) is the most popular of my tools.
It is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), feature rich and can save companies tens of thousand Euros/US-Dollars per year.
